## Hi, my name is Jacob
I was originally born in Florida, but currently reside in the  Pacific Northwest. I am an cybersecurity professional. I hold a B.S in cybersecurity from Western Washington University (NSA CAE-D Certified) and have a range of interests in the industry. 

I interned at [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/en-us) in the summer of 2022, and worked as a operational resilience analyst. My work focused on control auditing, process workflow improvements, and secure software life cycle recommendations. Additionally, I have experience with [PISCES](https://pisces-intl.org/) as a network security analyst during my course work at WWU. 

I am open for work and prefer both in person or remote work opportunities.
