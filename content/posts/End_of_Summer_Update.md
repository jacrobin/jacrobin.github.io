Hello all!

I've been fairly quiet recently, mainly because I moved across the country and I started my new job in the spring. Both have been an experience to say the least. Obviously this has been a transitional period of my life and for the first time I am truly 'adult-ing'.

Another challenge is I don't have any of my gear. Its going to be a while until I get all my equipment to my new location. This married with my lack of free time has constrained exactly what projects I am going to pursue in the near future. I have some ideas, but a lot of my time in the next quarter or so is slated for education in the form of SANS classes or certificates/degrees. I would like to get to a place that I build foundational skills in something else in the IT/OT/cybersecurity space than I am currently doing, and have something of a side hustle in the coming years. But I acknowledge that this would mean the potential of having effectively two full time jobs. 

Needless to say, I have a lot of goals, very little plans, the perception of very little time, and a lot of potential. But we'll get there.

My current employer is very big proponent for personal development, and promotes the employee looking at other internal options to transition into to meet professional goals. For the mean time I am locked into my current role for at least two years, but more important to me, locked into a single physical location for two years. 

As of writing this I am 17% of the way through my obligation, so plenty of time to figure out the rest. The biggest goal right now is to be debt free within 2-3 years and start maxing out retirement savings. Which with my amount of debts and current salary these conditions easy to accomplish. Some secondary goals are to pick up fishing, windsurfing and stand up paddle ðŸŒŠ ðŸ¤™

Godspeed everyone, be safe
