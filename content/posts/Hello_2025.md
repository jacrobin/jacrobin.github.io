Well it is that time again...

2024 was a blur for myself personally and professionally. I grew a lot in some areas and stagnated in others. 2025 has kicked off a bit of a bumpy start, but I am confident this year will be even better than the last. I am already four months away from the first year anniversary of my new job, and I am really enjoying it! 

This year I'm mainly going to focus on growing at work, and securing my financial future. Within two years I will firmly be in the position of being debt free if I follow my strict budget and get promoted for the next two years. As mentioned I am already nearing my one year anniversary at work, meaning I am about 33% of the way through my two year commitment. While I can leave at any time, getting another job at work before the two year mark is not really possible and the work I am currently doing right now is not really what I want to do for the rest of my life. Being able to experiment without moving again would be beneficial, but it remains to be seen if I can mentally make it more than two years here. The good news is that I joined more of a mid-level office in terms of growth making moves to other offices or organizations easier.

Right now thought I am really just trying to feel out the job, environment and locality. Obviously, where I am living right now is not really my cup of tea, and saying goodbye to my family on my holiday trip back home was *really hard* this time around.

Moreover, everything outside of work is a bit of a challenge. I have friends and coworkers I enjoy doing stuff with outside of work with, but I just don't have the energy to work on interpersonal relationships like I did when I first moved to Washington State. This chapter in my life so far feels more like a temporary deviation from my PNW self. And at some point I will return to the PWN, like this was a long summer camp. At the same time I do not want to leave this place with the feeling there was unfinished business or something left on the table. Regardless, this year I want to work towards feeling *happy and positive*. Honestly 2019-2023 were some of the best years of my life. And in attempt to revert more to that mindset I am going to try to build back some of the healthier habits from that time period. And if I successfully do this, I'll report my findings here.

I feel like a lot of people in the Western world, especially in America, have a very negative outlook on life not only in the mid-term but also long-term. And yes there are a lot of reasons to feel that way. But it does not help anyone to dwell. Enjoy the sky, enjoy the food, enjoy the drink and enjoy the people. Put on some Tatsuro Yamashita and enjoy the ride.
