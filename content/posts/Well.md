So…yeah…things are kinda interesting in America right now. As a public servant, job security is turbulent to say the least. For the last few weeks I have been preparing for several scenarios when certain thresholds are met. My current goal is to make it at least to the two year mark at my current employer and then relocate to Washington if something pans out. However I must be ready for several scenarios where I may have to do that post haste. 

Leaving right now would be less than ideal, but if it has to happen, it has to. If something were to happen it would be very bitter sweet, part of my heart would stay here and with the people I worked with up until this point. 

On the flip side, being forced to once again become uncomfortable would likely prove an exciting, stressful and transformative transition. Just like last year lol.

In the meantime I have been looking to see what kinds of roles I may be able to move to with the experience I’ve gained so far and where those jobs would likely be located. I’ve also started to relearn a lot of the things from school. Basically teaching myself how to program again. I’m going to be documenting the entire process and really apply myself. Programming is something I’ve been meaning to get better at, but I’ve also chosen a path that could also help with reverse engineering efforts which I’ve also found very interesting in the past. Taking a few hours everyday and pretending I’m back in class will hopefully bring a sense of calm to my currently un-calm mind; especially on the weekends when I am not actively working. I’ve made a github for it but for the moment it is private and will likely become unprivated in the near future. I’m also hoping that if I gain more technical skills, mixed with my soft skills I may be able to have my own side gig or second job to either supplement what I am doing now or help pay for the gap after relocating back to Washington state.

Stay strong friends.
