      <description>Upgrading My Workflow For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know me, I love tinkering with hardware and software. I am also the type of person who will do something a hundred times before deciding on the best strategy for dealing with a given problem. I only just finished my undergraduate studies for cybersecurity, so for the last year or so my home lab was the last thing I was allocating time to. However, with all my new found free-time, I wanted something to work on in the midst of frantically applying to jobs.</description>

      <description>Hi, my name is Jacob I was originally born in Florida, but currently reside in the Pacific Northwest. I am an cybersecurity professional. I hold a B.S in cybersecurity from Western Washington University (NSA CAE-D Certified) and have a range of interests in the industry.
I interned at Twilio in the summer of 2022, and worked as a operational resilience analyst. My work focused on control auditing, process workflow improvements, and secure software life cycle recommendations.</description>
