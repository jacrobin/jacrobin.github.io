      <description>&lt;p&gt;So…yeah…things are kinda interesting in America right now. As a public servant, job security is turbulent to say the least. For the last few weeks I have been preparing for several scenarios when certain thresholds are met. My current goal is to make it at least to the two year mark at my current employer and then relocate to Washington if something pans out. However I must be ready for several scenarios where I may have to do that post haste.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well it is that time again&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2024 was a blur for myself personally and professionally. I grew a lot in some areas and stagnated in others. 2025 has kicked off a bit of a bumpy start, but I am confident this year will be even better than the last. I am already four months away from the first year anniversary of my new job, and I am really enjoying it!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
