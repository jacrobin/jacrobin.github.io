      <description>Hello all!
I&amp;rsquo;ve been fairly quiet recently, mainly because I moved across the country and I started my new job in the spring. Both have been an experience to say the least. Obviously this has been in a transitional period of my life and for the first time I am truly &amp;lsquo;adult-ing&amp;rsquo;.
Another challenge is I don&amp;rsquo;t have any of my gear. Its going to be a while until I get all my equipment to my new location.</description>

      <description>On February 7th, 2024 at 9:30 PM in Baghdad, Iraq the U.S military conducted an air strike on a single vehicle that contained a senior leader of Kataâ€™ib Hezbollah who USCENTCOM says both planned and took part in attacks of U.S forces in the region. At this time USCENTCOM says that other than the passengers there are no other fatalities.
For the past two days I have been trying to learn and practice practical OSINT.</description>

      <description>LETS GO 2024 Very excited for what is to come this year. After graduating in June with my B.S in cyber security I am poised to get employed sometime this year. While the news about the tech sector is doom and gloom, I do have some opportunities in the works. I have a conditional offer with the government, but I havn&amp;rsquo;t well, yet met the conditions (I guess), but in time everything should be good to go.</description>
